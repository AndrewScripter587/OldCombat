/**
The EReg class represents regular expressions.

While basic usage and patterns consistently work across platforms, some more
complex operations may yield different results. This is a necessary trade-
off to retain a certain level of performance.

EReg instances can be created by calling the constructor, or with the
special syntax `~/pattern/modifier`

EReg instances maintain an internal state, which is affected by several of
its methods.

A detailed explanation of the supported operations is available at
<https://haxe.org/manual/std-regex.html>
